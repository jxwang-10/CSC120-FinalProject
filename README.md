# CSC120-FinalProject

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)
 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?
 We did the Ss approach. We started small and simple. We mapped out how we wanted our classes to interact before we started coding. 

 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
 We implemented try-catch blocks for the first time, figured out that we need to make one scanner object to use across functions, and implementd "protected" instead of "private" attributes/functions in classes.

 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?
 If we had more time, we would add levels so you could play on easy mode and then hard mode. But we like the way we implemented this current structure.

 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?
 We could add more bosses, make your character construction different so that the type of character you are constrains your stats (ice mage, warrior, etc.). We could also make it to where the attack you choose has a greater effect (like a damage bar or the boss has designated resonses).

 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
 If we add more comments throughout our coding, it is easier for us to pick up where the other left off. We don't know her name, but the student who sat in front of us for the duration of the class gave us this advice.

 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?
 We would be more careful while pushing/pulling. It is always good to backup your work if you are potentially do something that might write over what you just did.

 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.
 Working with a team made the overall time spent on the project signficantly shorter. It is also made the project more fun! We did a good job understanding when we could/couldnt work on the project for whatever circumstances, and just meeting up when we could and splitting up the work load to the best of our abilities.
